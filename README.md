## Usage

**MercadoPago SDK v3.2.0** has now two modes of checkout usage, one is for Payment which resolves the entire payment process, and the other, returns a PaymentData object that you've to send to your servers, so you can perform a payment manually. 

Because of that change, the react-native bridge exposes two static methods inside of a class that let you use the MP checkout in both ways.

### Start Checkout for PaymentResult

A PaymentResult object will look like: 

```json
{
   "id": "122323232",
   "status": "approved"
}
```

This is how to call the checkout for Payment, the first parament is the **publicKey**, the next one is the **preferenceId**, and the last one is object where you can pass style customization. 

```javascript
import { MercadoPagoCheckout } from 'react-native-mercadopago-checkout';

let payment = await MercadoPagoCheckout.startForPayment('xsddgfdsdasdsa', 'sdsdf13323', {
    backgroundColor: '#414141',
    enableDarkFont: true
});
```

### Start Checkout for PaymentData

A PaymentData object will look like: 

```json
{
   "cardIssuerId": "john doe",
   "cardTokenId": "xsdfdgfdgdgfg",
   "paymentMethodId": "visa",
   "campaignId": "xzdsdsd",
   "installments": "1"
}
```

This is how to call the checkout for PaymentData, the first parament is the **publicKey**, the next one is the **preferenceId**, and the last one is object where you can pass style customization. 

```javascript
import { MercadoPagoCheckout } from 'react-native-mercadopago-checkout';

let paymentData = await MercadoPagoCheckout.startForPaymentData('xsddgfdsdasdsa', 'sdsdf13323', {
    backgroundColor: '#414141',
    enableDarkFont: true
});
```
